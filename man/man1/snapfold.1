.TH SNAPFOLDE 1NEMO "23 March 2018"
.SH NAME
snapfold \- fold a thin disk N-body snapshot file into a cone along Z axis
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsnapfold in=\fPsnap-file \fBout=\fPsnap-file [parameter=value] .\|.\|.
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIsnapfold\fP folds the positions and velocities of an
N-body snapshot file representing a thin disk. The disk can be folded
up to a cone around the +Z axis, or down to a cone around the -Z axis.
Fold angle (\fBtheta=\fP) must thus  be between -90 and +90.
.SH PARAMETERS
The following parameters are recognized; they may be given in any order.
.TP 24
\fBin=\fP\fIsnap-file\fP
Input data is read from \fIsnap-file\fP, which must be in snapshot format.
.TP
\fBout=\fP\fIsnap-file\fP
Output data is written to \fIsnap-file\fP.
.TP
\fBtheta=\fP\fIx-angle\fP
Fold Angle (in degrees).
Default: 0.0
.TP
\fBfill=t|f\fP
Fill the cone?  Otherwise it will be a thin wall.
Default: false

.SH EXAMPLES
Here is an example creating a tilted cone with outflow
.nf

  set nbody = 10000
  set vscale = 0
  set outflow = 1.0
  set cone = 30
  set inc = 30
  
.fi
here vscale controls how much rotation is left, and outflow how much radial outflow.
cone is the opening angle of the outflow, which points to the observer, but inc will
incline it from the sky/disk plane.
.nf

  mkdisk - $nbody mass=1 |\\
    snapscale - - vscale=$vscale |\\
    snapspin - - omega=$outflow outflow=t|\\
    snapfold - - theta=90-$cone |\\
    snaprotate - - $inc y |\\
    snapgrid - $out.vel moment=-1
    
.fi
In this example the outflow is perpendicular to a disk, which is not in this example.
A more expaned version is in the script \fBmk_cone\fP.
